# Photoshop Export all your fonts

I've created this script to export a text in all fonts, that are installed on my system. I further used this data to train an ML. 

## How To 

1. Create a Photoshop file, with a folder called 'text' and a text-layer in this folder. 
1. Type the text you want to output in the text-layer. 
1. The text should not be to large, try out a few fonts. 
1. Save the file on your system in a new folder.
1. Select File → Scripts → Browse and choose the downloaded script. 

The script will run through all your fonts and output them in the same folder where your PS-file sits.
